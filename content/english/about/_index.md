Jake is a new father to a young son, a husband to Tektons co-owner Mikal, and otherwise a reasonably good guy. He's got 12 chickens and live in Jacksonville, Florida. He decided to start his own business because he loves to build. Imagine that? The guy you're looking to hire to build, wanted to build his own _thing_. 

Along the way, he wanted his building hobby to be cleaner, to be stronger. He's got a perfectionists desire for what he's doing to be the best. It's rough, and he often feels in over his head when he begins, but he has to do it the hard way. Mortise and tenons, dovetails, half laps and bridal joints all stand out to him as some of the best ways to join wood together, for the strongest and longest lasting joints. So, that's what he does. That's what you'll get from him. 

Tekton is a small business, and our drive to achieve greater efficiency and service a larger customer base are part of what pushes us forward. The business model to lose clients as soon as you get them due to subpar work **isn't our style**. They get paid, so they're on to the next one and have forgotten about you. That's not us, that's not Tekton. We'd prefer if Tekton were your "I need this built, send me an invoice when it's done" small business. Of course, that doesn't happen over night. We'd prefer to get to know you, and make your wood working dreams come to life. 

Your home is one of your most precious places here on Earth, or at least that's the goal. We're steadily working toward that in the Schmidt house, but man it's tough because he's busy. **Hopefully, he's busy making it that way for you.**
